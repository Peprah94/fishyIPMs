# First meeting notes

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Objectives

-   Fit a population dynamic model (IPMs) with anthropogenic drivers \citep[human driven factors such as climate change, direct exploitation, pollution, biological invasions, sea-use change; ][]{moullec2021identifying}.

-   The IPM should be a mechanistic model \citep[plug and play;][]{frost2023integrated, smallegange2017mechanistic}. The IPMs should describe how the variables affect population.

-   IPMs should model temporal trends in human characteristics using variables that indicate catchment state of each year and a continuous time series data.

-   Produce prediction maps (of what?)

## Covariates to use

-   Easily accessible variables e.g. using remote censored data

-   environmental covariates

# Example data received

The data is explained in \cite{baerum2021population}.

The following data have been received:

## Dataset 1: Individual data for some fish populations

-   Each row = one individual fish

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
Example1 <- read_delim("Example1.csv", delim = ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

#explore data
colnames(Example1)
#summary(Example1)
```

### Column names and their meaning

I would love to have the meaning of the column names to make meaning of the data. I am only guessing, but my guesses may be wrong. I think:

-   `dato` - Date data was collected. The date is between 01.07.2007 to 01.08.2008.

-   `Juli` - July, but it has different codes. What do they mean?

Most of the column names are abbrevations.

Looking at the dataset and the summary, is it safe to say this is a data with presence of multiple species (hopefully at a given location, but I cannot find a location name, lake name or ID). This is because I could not find the counts of the fishes at the lake. If the data is for each lake or location, the absences can also be inferred.

## Dataset 2: Subsample of dataset 1

Here the ID represents and individual fish.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Example2 <- read_delim("Example2.csv", delim = ";", 
    escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
colnames(Example2)
summary(Example2)
```

*Do we link both datasets by their IDs?*

NOTE: There is no ID in the first dataset. So do I link them by species or develop a species-specific IPM?

## Dataset 3: Catchment collected per lake

-   Each row represents a lake

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
catchments <- read_csv("NO_all_vars_over_catchments.csv")
colnames(catchments)
summary(catchments)
```
